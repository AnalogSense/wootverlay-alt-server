An alternative server for [Woot-verlay](https://github.com/DjCrqss/Woot-verlay) that also works on Linux.

## Usage Notes

- You still visit <https://djcrqss.github.io/Woot-verlay/> as this project only aims to provide an alternative server.
- You will need to set up [appropriate udev rules](https://analogsense.org/udev-rules/) so that your keyboard input can be read without root privileges.
